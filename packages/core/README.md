# Yode - Focused Code Editing

Edit smaller parts of a code base, so you can focus better on the important parts of a task.
You can edit functions of JavaScript code as deeper level of a file.
By focusing on functions of interest you can open an editor for each of it and
arrange them to serve as context of your work. This frees you from the clutter
of the rest of the file, containing this function.
Yode is designed as library, so it can be integrated in existing text editors
([NeoVim](https://neovim.io/ ),
[Atom](https://atom.io/ ), ...).
